DHG is an application platform of blockchain technology which aims to build the internet of things system for next generation blockchain. Since Satoshi Nakamoto invented the bitcoin, both virtual currency and blockchain develop rapidly. After the exploration of coin in several years ago, now we step into the era to explore the blockchain. And next we will develop the network. The ultimate goal of DHG is to build a blockchain network system and become the underlying protocol for the Internet of things.

DHG is decentralized value transfer protocol and distributed database system. Based on Cryptography and Game Theory, the data is automatically backed up in all nodes in the world and all miners work together to maintain the security of the network. No organization or individual is privileged to tamper with the data in the system. So it¡¯s a credit system. Users can issue smart contracts on DHG depending on side chain, merge mining, EVM with turing-computable function etc. Once issued, the smart contracts will strictly follow the established rules. So DHG is the foundation for automation and intelligence, as well as the basic protocol on the development of the Internet of things.

At first, DHG is a digital asset management system, so anyone can use DHG to publish a digital asset based on blockchain, and these digital assets are freely circulated in the blockchain by DHG, and it don¡¯t be controlled by the issuer.

Meanwhile, DHG is the short for a specific built-in token in DHG blockchain, its amount is constant, and it¡¯s also the value transfer medium of DHG network and cloud computing fuel for blockchain.

Sidechain is the core of DHG, which use 2-way peg and merge mining technology. The tokens can be circulated in a particular form between the main chain and the sidechain. The sidechain not only share the burden of the main chains, but also make the blockchain system more flexible, and it¡¯s also one of the ways to achieve decentralized application (DAPP).

Smart contract is the key application of blockchain, and it¡¯s the basis of automation and intellectualization. Now with the development of the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), DHG will be compatible with EVM when appropriate. 

DHG is compliant to the development trend of blockchain, on the basis of virtual currency and blockchain development, it defines and develops the networking protocol of blockchain, and DHG will build an application platform of blockchain technology around the world.
