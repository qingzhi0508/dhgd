Intro
-----
DHG is an application platform of blockchain technology which aims to build the internet of things system for next generation blockchain. Since Satoshi Nakamoto invented the bitcoin, both virtual currency and blockchain develop rapidly. After the exploration of coin in several years ago, now we step into the era to explore the blockchain. And next we will develop the network. The ultimate goal of DHG is to build a blockchain network system and become the underlying protocol for the Internet of things.
